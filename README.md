## Technical Details:
#### Server side code:
##### Node.js Server

* The server is used to call the Yelp API and return the data to the client in form of JSON.
* The server was used to have more control over the data retrieved from Yelp. Only the data necessary for the gourmet.com was returned from server side and other data returned from Yelp was eliminated.
* The Node.js server was designed to detect the keyword "search" in the request URL. If detected, the two parameter values "term" and "location" was passed to the Yelp API to get the relevant data. (Eg: term = food and location= Fullerton would return all the food joints in Fullerton).
```javascript
var server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {
      var parameters = url.parse(req.url, true);
      var query = parameters.query;
      var reqTerm = query["term"];
      var reqLoc = query["location"];
      console.log(parameters);
      if(parameters.pathname.includes('search')){
        console.log("In Search if");
        yelp.accessToken(clientId, clientSecret).then(response => {
           const token = response.jsonBody.access_token;
           const client = yelp.client(token);
           client.search({
               term: reqTerm,
               location: reqLoc
           }).then(response => {
             
                res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application.json');
                res.end(JSON.stringify(response.jsonBody.businesses));
           });
       });
    }
```

#### Client side code:
##### Ember app
* In searchpage there are two input fields which accepts "term" and "location". (Eg: term=food and location="Fullerton" will display all the food joints in Fullerton)
* After submitting the values, alias of the model was created in the controller and returned the values to the "input" action method of the route.
```javascript
export default Ember.Controller.extend({
  search: Ember.computed.alias('model.search'),
  actions: {
    displayres() {
      var self = this;
      var re = this.get('search');
      var food = re.term;
      var location = re.term;
      self.send('input', re);
    }
  }
});
```
* In route, Object was created for the model and in "input" action method the values were passed to the "search" route as parameters.
```javascript
model(){
    return Ember.RSVP.hash({
      search: Ember.Object.create()
    });
},
actions: {
  input: function(response){
    this.transitionTo('search', response.term, response.location);
  }
}
```
* In search route, the accepted parameters were passed as parameters to the Node.js server and data was returned into the Ember model.
```javascript
export default Ember.Route.extend({
  model(params){
    var host = this.store.adapterFor('searchapplication').get('host');
    var url = host + '/search?term='+params.term+'&location='+params.location+'';
    return Ember.$.getJSON(url);
  }
});
```
* The returned data was then displayed in the search results.

#Realtime user reviews using Firebase

- User reviews is displayed on the url.
- User can add reviews about the website using "Rate Us" link.
- Once user click the "Rate Us" link, two input box will appear. One input box will accepts the user's name and another input box accepts the user's review.  

```javascript
<div class="new-msg-link">{{#link-to 'messages.new'}}Add a new message{{/link-to}}</div>

{{outlet}}
{{#each model as |message|}}
    <div class="each-msg">{{message.name}}: {{message.body}}</div>
{{/each}}
Controller
```

* In message controller, the addMessage function will create a record and update it in Firebase database through emberfire adapters. 
```javascript
import Ember from 'ember';

export default Ember.Controller.extend({
    actions: {
        addMessage: function() {
            var newMessage = this.store.createRecord('message', {
                name: this.get('name'),
                body: this.get('body')
            });
            newMessage.save();
            this.setProperties({
                name: '',
                body: ''
            });
        }
    }
});
```

* In message model, the model imports the DS from ember-data and it exports attributes to the controller

```javascript
import DS from 'ember-data';

export default DS.Model.extend({
  name: DS.attr('string'),
  body: DS.attr('string')
});

```
